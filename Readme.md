#Scala Matrices

This is a matrix libary written in Scala as an exercise to try and get the hang of typeclasses.

It currently suffers from rounding errors when using larger matrices or using the inverse function.
Use of the Spire Number class mitigates this slightly but still causes a lot of problems.
